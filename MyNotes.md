Deliverables:
- Code, with comment
- A readme in a form of report
- a recording of your code running smoothly

To Run:  
source /home/michelleeileens/421/.venv/bin/activate
python src/main.py

Notes:
- For some reason, simulated annealing takes a while, CPU time 2 detik pdhl laine 0. smth

Next steps in order of priority:

4. Add Visualization Enhancements:
   ```python
   # In src/visualization/plotting.py
   - Add solution improvement plots
   - Add generation/iteration tracking
   - Create hyperparameter analysis plots
   - Add animation for solution evolution
   ```

5. Comprehensive Testing:
   ```python
   # In tests/
   - Test all algorithms on different problem sizes
   - Compare with A* optimal solutions
   - Analyze hyperparameter effects
   - Generate plots for report
   ```

6. Extra Credit Attempt:
   ```python
   # In src/extra_credit.py
   - Load extra_credit.txt
   - Try different algorithm combinations
   - Implement solution improvements
   - Track and save best solution
   ```

7. Report Generation:
   - Collect all experimental results
   - Generate required plots and tables
   - Answer all questions from each section
   - Document implementation decisions
   - Analyze algorithm trade-offs
